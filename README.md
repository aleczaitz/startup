This is a platform to race type against your friends and other strangers in real time

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Typing quickly and accurately is one of the most increasingly important skills for anyone in almost any industry. There are many websites to practice and measure your typing speed, put you are always only comparing your speed either with yourself. Plus everyone knows that multiplayer games are more fun than single player games. Welcome to Jorvo.

### Design

![Design image](JorvoWireframe.png)

The web app design will be simple yet fun with lots of personality. There will be a home page, a challenge page, and a log page, and a single player page.

### Key features

- A user can make an account and add their friends accounts
- Users can challenge their friends to a race which puts both users against eachother typing the same quote
- Both users will be able to see each others progress in real time
- The user will have access to past games

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structure basic layout of all of the pages including auth, challenge page, and friends and games dashboard
- **CSS** - Set a consistent pallet for colors and reusable, responsive designs 
- **React** - React will be used for building the forms for and updating the match between users in real time
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - Authentication
  - Requesting/accepting friend invites
  - Creating matches
  - Reading match stats
- **DB/Login** - Store users, relationships, match results
- **WebSocket** - Create a websocket connection between users for the matches
- **3rd Party API** - Use a quotes api as the text that is typed between users
