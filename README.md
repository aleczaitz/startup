# ParkPal

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application is a platform to connect event-goers to local driveway hosts that are willing to rent out their driveway space as event parking.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Unless you arrive an hour or two early, event parking is always an inconsistent, dreaded part of going to the game, concert, festival, etc. Instead of hoping that you'll find a magic street parking spot, confirm your time and space by booking a local nieghbors driveway as your parking for the night. The homeowner makes the easiest passive income of their lives, and both parties walk away with a great experience. 

### Design

![Design image](ParkpalMocks.png)

The web app design will be as simple and intuitive as possible, since people want to think about parking the least they can. There will be a page with a map to find a driveway easily, as well as a simple form to post a listing.

```

### Key features

- Hosts can post their driveway to specific events
- Drivers can book host's driveway during their event
- Hosts can collect payouts and Drivers can pay directly through the web app
- Hosts and Drivers can communicate through the app

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structure basic layout of all of the pages including auth, driveway select page, and hosting dashboard
- **CSS** - Set a consistent pallet for colors and reusable, responsive designs 
- **React** - React will be used for building the forms to collect information from drivers and hosts as well as setting the state for pages. 
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - Authentication
  - Posting driveways
  - Looking up available driveways by event
  - Booking Specific Driveways
  - Messaging between host and driver
- **DB/Login** - Store users, venues, events, driveways, and bookings in database with clear rules to certain data
- **WebSocket** - The database will be the source of truth for available driveways and bookings
